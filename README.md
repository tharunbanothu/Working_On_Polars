# Custom DataFrames and Advanced Python Concepts using Polars

This project showcases the creation and manipulation of custom DataFrames using the high-performance [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) library in Python. Alongside DataFrame operations, it also demonstrates key Python concepts such as file handling, functional programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and advanced Python techniques â€” all integrated to build scalable and maintainable data workflows.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Custom Polars DataFrames creation and manipulation
- âœ… File handling (CSV, JSON, and custom data formats)
- âœ… Functional programming with reusable utility functions
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- âœ… Lazy vs Eager evaluation using Polars
- âœ… Advanced Python features: 
  - Decorators
  - Generators
  - Lambda functions
  - Type hinting and annotations
  - Error handling (try-except, custom exceptions)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `polars` â€“ for DataFrame operations
  - `typing` â€“ for type hints and schema safety
  - (Optional) `pandas` â€“ for performance comparisons

# Custom DataFrames using Polars

This project showcases how to build and manipulate custom DataFrames using the [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) library in Python â€” a fast, multi-threaded DataFrame library designed for performance and scalability. The goal is to demonstrate custom implementations and operations like filtering, aggregation, transformation, and schema manipulation using Polars.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Creating custom Polars DataFrames from scratch
- Performing common data operations (filter, groupby, joins, sorting, etc.)
- Type-safe schema definitions
- Handling large-scale data efficiently using lazy evaluation
- Comparison with pandas (optional)
- Optimizations for performance and memory usage

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `polars` â€“ for DataFrame operations
  - `typing` â€“ for type hints and schema safety
- (Optional) `pandas` â€“ for comparison in performance
