# Custom DataFrames using Polars

This project showcases how to build and manipulate custom DataFrames using the [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) library in Python â€” a fast, multi-threaded DataFrame library designed for performance and scalability. The goal is to demonstrate custom implementations and operations like filtering, aggregation, transformation, and schema manipulation using Polars.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Creating custom Polars DataFrames from scratch
- Performing common data operations (filter, groupby, joins, sorting, etc.)
- Type-safe schema definitions
- Handling large-scale data efficiently using lazy evaluation
- Comparison with pandas (optional)
- Optimizations for performance and memory usage

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `polars` â€“ for DataFrame operations
  - `typing` â€“ for type hints and schema safety
- (Optional) `pandas` â€“ for comparison in performance
